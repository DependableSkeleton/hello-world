# hello-world
Not just another repository!
This repository is gonna be my template for anything in the future, so for now this README can stay relatively empty.  
Unless of course the more I write the more internet points I get, but I don't think that's how it works.
So apparently I was supposed to edit this on a new branch. Oh well, I jumped the gun, just don't worry about it.
